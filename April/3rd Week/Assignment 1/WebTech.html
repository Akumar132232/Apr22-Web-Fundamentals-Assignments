    <h1>Web Technologies</h1>
    <h2>html</h2>
    <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a
        web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
        such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the
        documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
        included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
    <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
        interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents
        by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
    </p>
    <p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and
        content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium
        (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS
        over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and
        audio, primarily using the element, in collaboration with javascript.</p>

    <h2>css</h2>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a
        markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
        JavaScript.</p>
    <p>CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C
        specifications. Previously, development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which
        allowed versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, CSS3. However, CSS4
        has never become an official version.</p>


    <h2>JS</h2>
    <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class
        functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments
        also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm,
        single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional
        programming) styles. </p>
    <p>This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are specific to Web pages or
        other host environments. For information about API specifics to Web pages, please see Web APIs and DOM.</p>
    <p>The standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262) and the ECMAScript
        Internationalization API specification (ECMA-402). The JavaScript documentation throughout MDN is based on the
        latest draft versions of ECMA-262 and ECMA-402 and in cases where some proposals for new ECMAScript features
        have already been implemented in browsers, documentation and examples in MDN articles may use some of those new
        features</p>
    <p>Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or
        registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages have
        very different syntax, semantics, and use.</p>

    <h2>React JS</h2>
    <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.</p>
    <p>React is a JavaScript-based UI development library. Facebook and an open-source developer community run it.
        Although React is a library rather than a language, it is widely used in web development. The library first
        appeared in May 2013 and is now one of the most commonly used frontend libraries for web development</p>
    <p>eact offers some outstanding features that make it the most widely adopted library for frontend app development.
