 1. Explain difference between var/ let const by giving examples.
Ans: --> var	            
	-can re declare     
	-can re initialize
	ex:- b=20
	     console.log(b)
	     
	     b=30
	     console.log(b)
	
      --> let
	-can re initilize/assign 
	-can't re declare 
	ex:-let b;
	    console.log(b)
	
      --> const
      	-in case of const dclaration and initialization should be done in the same line
	-can't re-declare in the case of const                                          
	-can't re-initialize 
	ex:- const pi=3.14
	     console.log(pi)   
	     
	     
2. What is the difference between null , undefined and not defined?
Ans:- 1)undefined  --> haven't assigned any value to the variable
      2)not-defined --> when variable is not present in the code 
      3)null --> empty or unknown value.
 
3.What is initialisation and declaration? Check if for a given length and breadth, is the shape a square or rectangle. (eg: Let's say the length is 10 and breadth is 20, and then check).
Ans:-   Declaration:-
	-The process of Creating a variable in JavaScript is called declaration.
	
	Initilazation:-
	-assigning an initial value to a variable

	let l=10
	let b=10
	if(l==b)
	{
	    console.log("The given shape is square")
	}
	else
	{
	    console.log("The given shape is Rectangle")
	}



4. Check if a number is odd or even using if-else statement.
Ams:-  let num6 = 15;
	if(num6%2==0)
	  {
    		console.log(num6+" is an Even number")
	  }
	else
	  {
    		console.log(num6+" is an Odd number")
	  }


5. Using SWITCH statement, get the day of the week based on day number, means if the day is 1, the day of week is Sunday. If the day is 2 , it's Monday and so on.
	Ans:- let num=5;
	switch (num) {
	  case 1:
	    day = "Sunday";
	    console.log(day);
	    break;
	  case 2:
	    day = "Monday";
	    console.log(day);
	    break;
	  case 3:
	     day = "Tuesday";
	    console.log(day);
	    break;
	  case 4:
	    day = "Wednesday";
	    console.log(day);
	    break;
	  case 5:
	    day = "Thursday";
	    console.log(day);
	    break;
	  case 6:
	    day = "Friday";
	    console.log(day);
	    break;
	  case 7:
	    day = "Saturday";
	    console.log(day);
	    break;
	    default:console.log("Please enter valid input")
	  }
