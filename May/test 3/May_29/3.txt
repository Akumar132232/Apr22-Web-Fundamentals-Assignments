3.What is initialisation and declaration? Check if for a given length and breadth, is the shape a square or rectangle. (eg: Let's say the length is 10 and breadth is 20, and then check).

      	Initilazation:-
	      -assigning an initial value to a variable

        let b=10
        if(l==b)
        {
            console.log("The given shape is square")
        }
        else
        {
            console.log("The given shape is Rectangle")
        }
