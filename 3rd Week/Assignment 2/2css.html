    <p>Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a
        markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
        JavaScript.</p>
    <p>CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C
        specifications. Previously, development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which
        allowed versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, CSS3. However, CSS4
        has never become an official version.</p>
