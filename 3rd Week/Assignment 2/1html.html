   <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a
       web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
       such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the
       documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
       included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
   <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
       interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents
       by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
   </p>
   <p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and
       content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium
       (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS
       over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and
       audio, primarily using the element, in collaboration with javascript.</p>
