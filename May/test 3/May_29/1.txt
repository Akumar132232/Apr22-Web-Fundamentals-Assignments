 1. Explain difference between var/ let const by giving examples.
Ans: --> var	            
        -can re declare     
        -can re initialize
        ex:- b=20
             console.log(b)
	     
             b=30
             console.log(b)
	
      --> let
        -can re initilize/assign 
        -can't re declare 
        ex:-let b;
            console.log(b)
	
      --> const
      	-in case of const dclaration and initialization should be done in the same line
	      -can't re-declare in the case of const                                          
      	-can't re-initialize 
      	ex:- const pi=3.14
	       console.log(pi)
